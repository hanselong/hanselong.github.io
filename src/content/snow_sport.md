# Before You Go
Things to consider before your first day on snow (each section includes cost considerations):
1. Which snow sport?
2. Where to go?
3. Appropriate clothing (if you're uncomfortably cold/warm, you're dressed inappropriately for the weather)
4. Proper Equipment
5. How to Stay Safe
6. Transportation

# Which Snow Sport? (In order of difficulty)
* Cross-Country Skiing (a.k.a. Nordic Skiing)
    * Recommended for: People who like to take it slower with minimal risks and prefer a hiking-like atmosphere/culture.
    * Difficulty: Low to start with.  Some sliding and balance needed.  Easier to balance and control than ice skating or inline/roller skating.  Beginner level is mostly flat, at most 5-10 MPH top speed.
    * Clothing Requirement: Wear what you normally would for jogging + water/windproof outer layer (top, bottom, and gloves).  Most Nordic skiers wear a beanie or hat at most; almost no one wear a helmet.
    * Equipment comfort level: most comfortable - "boots" are similar to regular shoes, skis and poles are thin and light.
    * Cost: Least expensive for purchase (ballpark $300).  No lift tickets needed until advanced routes; some places require trail pass.  
        * Ballpark cost for equipment first-time rental: $35
        * Ballpark cost for clothing: $100 (assuming Costco-type purchase for the water/windproof outer layer and gloves).
        * Ballpark cost for lesson: $140 total for two-hour lesson for two people
* Alpine/Downhill Skiing
    * Recommended for: People who enjoy some speed/challenge as well as a structured progression in the sport (i.e. people who enjoy repeated drills to master a skill before learning something new).
    * Difficulty: Medium difficulty - similar difficulty level as first-time ice skating, but typically falling on snow is less painful than falling on ice.  Learning terrain has some slope to facilitate downhill movement; most beginners struggle to control the skis at first (stopping, turning, etc.).  Possible to reach 10-15 MPH top speed depending on slope and snow conditions.
    * Clothing Requirement: Base Layer + Snow Jacket + Snow Pants recommended.  Wear what you would wear for walking around town at near-freezing temperatures + snow resistant layer.  Avoid materials that soak up water/sweat e.g. Jeans.  Helmet recommended.  Ski socks highly recommended for comfort and safety (feet should stay somewhat warm).
    * Equipment comfort level: uncomfortable - "boots" are very stiff and very difficult to get in/out of.  Skis are heavy and likely to feel unwieldy at first.
    * Cost: Most expensive for purchase (ballpark $1000); highly recommend renting at first. Magic Carpet ticket or beginner lift ticket only for the first few times to save on money.
        * Ballpark cost for equipment first-time rental: $60 (variable depending on where you rent from)
        * Ballpark cost for clothing: $250 (assuming Costco-type purchase for snow clothing, base layer, mittens, helmet, ski socks)
        * Ballpark cost for lesson: $120 per person for two-hour group lesson or $400 per person for two-hour private lesson.
* Snowboarding
    * Recommended for: People who enjoy facing their fears, conquering difficult challenges, with a "I can figure this out one way or another" type tenacity. Snowboarders often prefer "getting the gist" of how to do things and experimenting with a "YOLO" (You Only Live Once) attitude.
    * Difficulty: High Difficulty unless you are comfortable with other board sports (e.g. skateboard, surfboard, paddleboard), likely to be challenging even if you are comfortable with other board sports.  Expect to fall repeatedly unless you are with a decent snowboard instructor.  While it's possible to reach 10-15 MPH top speed in beginner terrain, most first-timers will likely fall over before such speeds are reached.
    * Clothing Requirement: Same as Alpine/Downhill Skiing; Helmet highly recommended - head and shoulder injuries are the most common injuries for snowboarders.
    * Equipment comfort level: Snowboard boots are more stiff than hiking boots, but more comfortable than ski boots.  Beginner snowboards are typically ligher and easier to maneuver (but still challenging for first-timers).  For safety, especially if learning on your own, you should wear sufficient protection for your wrist, knees, and tailbone (a bruised or broken tailbone could take up to 12 months to heal).
    * Cost: Medium cost for starter equipment (ballpark $600); recommend renting at first especially if you have little to no experience with either snow sports or other board sports. Getting a snowboard lesson from a decent snowboard instructor is your best bet for enjoyment, safety, and continued pursue of the sport (or you might decide it's not for you).
        * Ballpark cost for equipment rental, clothing, and lesson are about the same as in Alpine/Downhill Skiing ($60, $250, $120 respectively)
